    <h2>My Other Best Friend, Cormac</h2>

    <h3>by <a href="mailto:kassem.k@northeastern.edu">Kareem Kassem</a></h3>

    <p class='A'>I have two friends named Cormac, they are both my best friend.
        One of them is from Minnesota, and we met right before college. We both applied early, and we were both using social media to make
        potential friends. He was the first person I followed on Instagram, and the first person from Northeastern I had a conversation with.
        I think we clicked because we were both nervous about the impending change (high school at home to college in the city), and having someone
        in a similar boat helped us both feel more comfortable. I'm glad I found him early on in college because having a solid constant support to turn to
        has made the tougher, busier times more manageable. This year we did a lot of random stuff, and visited a lot of random places (see below for a picture of us in Cape Cod).
        Cormac is like another brother I never had (I think my bar for brother's might be low, but even if they were high he'd pass the test). We are both graduating in May,
        and we have been talking a lot about doing a fun trip over the summer. We want to work on a farm, through WWOOF (worldwide opportunities on farms). I hope that it works out.
