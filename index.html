    <h1>My Best Friend, Cormac</h1>

    <h3>by <a href="mailto:kassem.k@northeastern.edu">Kareem Kassem</a></h3>

    <p class='A'>I have two friends named Cormac, they are both my best friend.
        One of them is from Connecticut, and we met in high school. He was my first friend at my new school
        and helped me get into the swing of things in my new town. I do Christmas and Thanksgiving with his family,
        and he helps me clean out my Mom's garage when we're both home at the same time. He's like the brother I never had. 
        (I have a brother he just sucks). Cormac also has a brother, and two sisters, and they all treat me like family. Cormac
        goes to school in Boulder (Colorado), so we don't get to see eachother too much because flights are expensive and we're
        both broke, but the few times a year we do get to see eachother, we don't skip a beat! I think we're both going to be home this summer
        for the first time in a while, so I'm hoping we can get back to what we used to do and go on some hikes, explore some new places, and 
        pretty much just hang out a lot. This will be one of the last summers before we both have to get real jobs and start real adult lives,
        so we've gotta make the most of it while we can.
